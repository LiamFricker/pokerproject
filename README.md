This is the final version of the poker developer software. For more detailed
instructions on installation and the program, please refer to the user manual and software specification.
Please make sure GTK 2.0 is installed to run ./client and make test.
You can also run "make clean all test". 

A demonstration of the AI's capabilities can be found in the AI unit test -> ./ai_UnitTest or in make test. 
While it is not currently  compatible with the program, it boasts excellent power and efficiency and 
can be found in the src code. 

Please make sure GTK 2.0 is installed to run ./client and make test. Be aware that rarely the client 
may crash without warning. If so, please reboot the client and try again.
The program also possesses a scoring system and a scoreboard system outputted in the terminal at the end 
of a game.
