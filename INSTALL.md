Five Aces Installation
===================

The developer must have access to a machine running Linux OS or access to a server with Linux OS installed on it. 

To install:
-----------

* The poker program is inside the ‘Poker_V1.0_src.tar.gz’ file that contains all the source files needed to run the program. 
* They can extract the archive by running “gtar xvzf Poker_V1.0_src.tar.gz”. 
* Go into the source file directory by using “cd Poker_V1.0_src”
* The developer can then run “make” and the poker server and client executables should be in the “bin” directory.
* The server can be ran with ./server while the client can be ran with ./client.
* You can also run "make clean all test".
